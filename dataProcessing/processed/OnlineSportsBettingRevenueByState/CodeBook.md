- Also known as Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR), this is the amount retained by the sportsbook after paying out winnings. It's calculated by subtracting the total payouts to winners from the handle. For instance, if the handle is $100 million and $92 million is paid out to winners, the revenue is $8 million.
#### Handle
- type: float64
- The total amount of money wagered by bettors within a given period. It represents the sum of all bets placed, regardless of the outcome. For example, if bettors in a state wager $100 million in a month, the handle for that month is $100 million.
#### Hold
- type: float64
- This represents the percentage of the handle that the sportsbook retains as revenue. It's calculated by dividing the revenue by the handle and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Using the previous example, if the revenue is $8 million and the handle is $100 million, the hold is 8%.
#### Taxes
- type: float64
- The amount of money that sportsbooks are required to pay to the state or jurisdiction from their revenue. Tax rates vary by state and are applied to the revenue generated by the sportsbooks. For example, if a state imposes a 10% tax rate on sports betting revenue, and a sportsbook earns $8 million in revenue, it would owe $800,000 in tax.
